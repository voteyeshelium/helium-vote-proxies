# What is a Voting Proxy?

**Note: This is currently a work in progress based on a [proposal in Helium](https://github.com/helium/HIP/pull/925). Details are subject to change as discussion continues.

A voting proxy is a wallet that can vote on behalf of other wallets. A voting wallet can choose to assign their votes to a given proxy.

An example of this would be assigning your voting power to your friend who knows more about Helium. 

## What is Recursive Assignment?

A proxy voter can assign all of their votes to another proxy. So, for example, you could assign your votes to a friend who assigns those votes to a neighbor. Vote assignments form a chain of trust, and in the ideal case concentrate voting power around knowledgeable and trusted individuals.

## Can I override Proxy Votes?

Yes! If you do not like the vote your proxy makes, you can always override it. You can also revoke the assignment at any time!

## Seasons

Proxy voting is split up in yearly seasons, similar to government election cycles. All proxies are reset on August 1st. This ensures that proxies must work to keep their voting power, and voters must reevaluate their assignments yearly.

# Adding a Proxy

To add a proxy, fork this repository and make a pull request containing the following:

- An entry in [proxies.json](/proxies.json)
- Any necessary files and assets in a folder under the [proxies](/proxies) folder

First, add the proxy to the [proxies.json](/proxies.json) file. Each proxy should have the following properties:

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
